<p>COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has taken over the modern world in an unprecedented
outbreak, caused by a newly uncovered strain of coronavirus (<a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019">WHO</a>, 2020). COVID-19 has
become one of the greatest threats to global health and security, affecting millions and killing
thousands across all inhabited continents. Countries implemented lockdowns in their respective
cities, leaving schools and workplaces closed, forcing millions of children and adults to be
confined to the limited space of their homes, leaving only for stocking up on supplies or seeking
medical help.</p>

  <h2 id=technologyUse>How does COVID-19 Affect the Use of Technology?</h2>
  <p>After the initial outbreak and the resulting lockdown, there was a massive surge in the use of technology. The inability to go into work, school and generally socialise led to huge increases in the use of online communication services and online entertainment platforms. Social media platforms, video chat and calling applications, and entertainment services have seen their userbases soar. Technology is also assisting with the tracking and monitoring of the virus, with track and trace services being developed and deployed all around the world. However, this large increase in traffic led to a larger spread of online misinformation, which in turn needs to prevented and understood.</p>

  <h2 id=ourTopic>Online Misinformation and Prevention Steps</h2>
  <p>False information surrounding the virus is in abundance online. At the time of the initial outbreak various conspiracy theories around the spread and cure for the virus surfaced, scammers took advantage of the scared and elderly, and hate speech increased, with the blame being placed on Asian people for the virus. Social media enhanced the spread of misinformation as every user has their own platform to put content out for everyone to see. The prevention of online misinformation is a key issue as it is extremely difficult to monitor and control.</p>
